2. run CodeSim in terminal with "./codesim code1.cpp code2.cpp"
   1. code1 and code2 are source file which need to be compare.
   2. run "./codesim -h" for more information
3. or user can run "build.sh" with root to install codesim
   1. after installing codesim, user may run codesim with "codesim code1.cpp code2.cpp"
